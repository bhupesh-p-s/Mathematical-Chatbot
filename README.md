# Mathematical-Chatbot
This is a basic chatbot implemented in Python that responds to user greetings and performs basic mathematical operations.

## Contents of the repo
The repository contains a readme.md file, a bot.py file which contains the code and an image of the ouput.

## Usage

* To use the chatbot, simply run the script in your terminal or IDE. 
* The script will first greet you and then ask you what mathematical operation you want to perform.
* You can choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* After selecting an operation, you will be asked to enter two operands. 
* If you choose division, the chatbot will check that the second operand is not zero. 
* Once you enter the operands, the chatbot will calculate the result of the operation and display it.

* The chatbot will then ask you if you want to perform another operation. If you answer "yes" or "y", the chatbot will repeat the process. If you answer "no" or "n", the chatbot will say goodbye and exit.
